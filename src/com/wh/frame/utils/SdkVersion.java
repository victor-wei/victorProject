	 * Update to Honeycomb MR1 to support 7 inch tablets, improve screen compatibility mode, etc.

	 * As of this version, applications that don't say whether they support XLARGE screens will be

	 * {@link #GINGERBREAD} or later. Applications that don't support a screen size at least as
	 * large as the current screen will provide the user with a UI to switch them in to screen size
	 * compatibility mode.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This version introduces new screen size resource qualifiers based on the screen size in dp:
	 * see {@link android.content.res.Configuration#screenWidthDp},
	 * {@link android.content.res.Configuration#screenHeightDp}, and
	 * {@link android.content.res.Configuration#smallestScreenWidthDp}. Supplying these in

	 * {@link android.content.pm.ApplicationInfo#compatibleWidthLimitDp}, and

	 * screen size buckets and for older devices the appropriate buckets will be inferred from them.

	 * <p>
	 * New {@link android.content.pm.PackageManager#FEATURE_SCREEN_PORTRAIT} and
	 * {@link android.content.pm.PackageManager#FEATURE_SCREEN_LANDSCAPE} features are introduced in
	 * this release. Applications that target previous platform versions are assumed to require both
	 * portrait and landscape support in the device; when targeting Honeycomb MR1 or greater the
	 * application is responsible for specifying any specific orientation it requires.

	 * <ul>
	 * <li>For devices without a dedicated menu key, the software compatibility menu key will not be
	 * shown even on phones. By targeting Ice Cream Sandwich or later, your UI must always have its
	 * own menu UI affordance if needed, on both tablets and phones. The ActionBar will take care of
	 * this for you.
	 * <li>2d drawing hardware acceleration is now turned on by default. You can use
	 * {@link android.R.attr#hardwareAccelerated android:hardwareAccelerated} to turn it off if
	 * needed, although this is strongly discouraged since it will result in poor performance on
	 * larger screen devices.
	 * <li>The default theme for applications is now the "device default" theme:
	 * {@link android.R.style#Theme_DeviceDefault}. This may be the holo dark theme or a different
	 * dark theme defined by the specific device. The {@link android.R.style#Theme_Holo} family must
	 * not be modified for a device to be considered compatible. Applications that explicitly
	 * request a theme from the Holo family will be guaranteed that these themes will not change
	 * character within the same platform version. Applications that wish to blend in with the
	 * device should use a theme from the {@link android.R.style#Theme_DeviceDefault} family.
	 * <li>Managed cursors can now throw an exception if you directly close the cursor yourself
	 * without stopping the management of it; previously failures would be silently ignored.
	 * <li>The fadingEdge attribute on views will be ignored (fading edges is no longer a standard
	 * part of the UI). A new requiresFadingEdge attribute allows applications to still force fading
	 * edges on for special cases.
